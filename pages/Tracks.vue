      <p>
        Each track is designed to best accommodate a hacker's interests and
        skill level, and will have track-specific mentors for support and
        guidance during the weekend of Technica. During registration, hackers
        will select one of the four tracks they wish to participate in.
        <b>This year we are introducing a new Exploratory Track!</b>
        <br /><br />
        During the weeks leading up to Technica, there will be virtual workshops
        hosted that we highly recommend hackers to attend! Please note that some
        tracks may have limited capacity to be announced.

        >The beginner and startup tracks are in-person registrations only and

        description="The beginner track is designed for hackers who are new to hackathons and/or computer science! In this track, you will be provided with dedicated resources to help you explore computer science and its applications to your areas of interest (e.g. life sciences, arts & humanities, technology, etc.), learn technical skills such as coding, and succeed at Technica and beyond.

        Hackers are highly encouraged to attend the beginner track's exclusive workshops. The guided and hands-on workshops will help you set up your programming environment, introduce you to web development, and more! Get excited for the opportunity to build your own working website and collaborate with other hackers on meaningful projects.
        
        This track is for in-person attendance only."

        heading="Research Track"
        description="The research track is aimed towards undergraduate students interested in research! Participants will explore the fields of research and practical applications within computing fields. In this track, student teams will come together and collaboratively work together to solve a research challenge presented by faculty. Computing faculty and graduate students will serve as mentors on projects in their research areas.
        
        Along with providing hands-on research experience, the research will both introduce students to the basics of computer science research (CSR) and highlight the exciting opportunities that come with pursuing a graduate degree in computer science.
        
        Note that registering for this track does not guarantee admittance; you will receive another form in your registration email that you must also complete to be eligible for the research track.
        
        You must be a college/university student to register. Preference will be given to undergraduates."
